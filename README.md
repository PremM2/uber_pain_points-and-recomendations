# uber_pain_points-and-recomendations
This project presents an in-depth analysis of Uber’s revenue performance between the years 2014 and 2015. By leveraging historical ride and revenue data segmented by time periods, days, and months, the analysis identifies key patterns, revenue fluctuations, and areas of concern. The primary objective was to uncover underlying factors contributing to a significant 50% revenue decline and to extract actionable insights for business improvement.

Key aspects explored include temporal revenue distribution (early morning, office hours, midnight), seasonal trends, day-wise performance, and monthly fluctuations. The project highlights critical pain points such as underperforming early mornings, low office-hour revenues, and a notable slump during summer months and the first week of each month.

Using these insights, the project formulates strategic recommendations focused on dynamic pricing, targeted promotions, corporate engagement, and proactive monitoring to optimize revenue streams and drive sustainable growth.

The project not only enhances understanding of Uber’s revenue dynamics but also serves as a practical business intelligence case study illustrating how data-driven analysis can guide strategic decision-making in the ride-sharing industry.
